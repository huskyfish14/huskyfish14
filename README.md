Hi, Iâ€™m @huskyfish14! Right now I am making my way thru The Odin Project in order to learn web development and hopefully move on to other coding languages!
Coding has always been an interesting subject to me but I was always too intimidated to try it out until now. My main goal is to increase my skillset and
better my future!
